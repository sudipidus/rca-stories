This is a common space where we can share:

- mistakes we have done (which lead to some production issues), how we dealt and how we rectified
- If you have an interesting story please create a entry and raise a PR (template is ready)
- If you want to further discuss and share your opinions, head over to discussions


If you want to quickly share without having to raise a PR, please go ahead and fill this out: [share your own rca story](http://bit.ly/3UkJj5g)
(It triggers an issue creation here)


### Rationale
There are numerous IT companies worldwide. There are thousands of developers working on stuff, creating bugs, fixing those bugs, learning, relearning, etc. But most of that happens intra-org. Of course the big public companies with accountability share their learning and publish their major RCA (root cause analysis) but majority of them happen within the org. Most of them can't divulge those confidential information anyway.

But keeping the confidential information aside, there are a lot of learning opportunities from other's mistakes and learning for us. What if we avoid the sensitive confidential information and share those lessons for a collective learning experience.


(I am sick of this charade where you are asked to design 'book my show' and you go about adding boxes: this is api gateway, this is a cache and this is the db. Let's do some actual groundwork based learning!)



### Contributing
Add your experience inside `content/posts` in a markdown file. (Check any existing file for the format and tagging)

#### Why would you contribute?
First of all it will be anonymous. If you just fill out the google form (linked top right on about section), it will trigger an issue creation on this repo which will be reviewed and added as a post. (workflow does it). Issues will be listed under my name. (since it's my github token)

Let's give it a try, shall we?
